A simple Java app I made when I started to learn to code for Android and I have refactored with Eclipse refactoring tools.

### Why this on Github?
I was looking my old repositories, and I saw this one. This is a special piece of code for me because it was the beginning on the Android path, thanks to [androidcurso.com](http://www.androidcurso.com/).
I've have use this to explore refactoring tools in Eclipse, adding Javadoc and making code cleaner and more organized.
